title: "DM Searches : Mono-X"
teaching: 20
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How do you search for something you can't detect?"
- "What are 'physics objects' at the LHC?"
- "What are the basic aspects of a search at the LHC?"
objectives:
- "Review the basic conceptual aspects of searches at the LHC."
- "Appreciate the basic components of a 'physics signature'."
- "Understand the basics of inferential statistics and the CLs test statistic."
keypoints:
- "Missing transverse energy is **not** a thing - it is missing transverse momentum because it has a magnitude **and** a direction."
- "Detector smearing results from the physical limitations of our detectors precision."
- "Inferential statistics can be used to transform the observations made about an ensemble of events into statements about a physics model through the use of likelihoods."
