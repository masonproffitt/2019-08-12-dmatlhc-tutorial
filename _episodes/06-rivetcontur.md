title: "Rivet+Contur"
teaching: 20
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is Rivet? What is Contur?"
- "What is an unfolded distribution?"
- "What do existing measurements say about DM signatures?"
objectives:
- "Execute an existing Rivet analysis pertinent to our monojet signature."
- "Transform the analyzed spectra into exclusion limits on the DMsimp model using Contur."
keypoints:
- "Rivet is a platform by which we can 'safely' analyze particle physics truth record data."
- "An unfolded spectra is one for which the effects of detector resolution have been removed through a deconvolution."
- "We can infer things about parameters in a model by using the CLs test statistic."
